## Assignment 1 

I am taking CIS 106 as a first step toward a degree in computer science. I have no prior experience but I hope this class will give me a solid foundation to build off of. I have decided to use Python as my programming language since that is the language the examples will be given in. This seems like the least confusing way to get started. I hope learning this language will help me learn other languages with ease. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment I learned that there are many different ways to change source code. Commiting a change will erase the old version but cloning the original repository or branching off of it will keep the original repositoy unchanged. These different types of changes all play a role in version control. I also learned that there are many different IDE's available. Since I am using Python as my coding language I have chosen to use Thonny as my IDE. I'm finding it very easy to use and there are many online tutorials that are meant to help first time programmers like myself. 

## Assignment 3

In this assignment I learned a lot about variables and data types. For variables I learned that it is necessary to define what type of data that variable will represent (integer, real, string, boolian, etc.) before giving that variable a specific definition. I also learned about arithmetic operators and how to order it to insure the arithmetic in my program is done the way I intend. This will be useful in my future because arithmetic operators will be needed in many types of programs. 

## Assignment 4

In this assignment I was able to code my first program without the help of Flowgorithm. Using only the textbook as reference I was able to write a program that converts miles into yards, feet and inches. I was also able to successfully debug my program using Thonny's built in debugger. This is a good first step for me and gives me confidence to start confidence to start coding more difficult programs.
