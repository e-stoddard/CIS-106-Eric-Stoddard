## Assignment 1 

I am taking CIS 106 as a first step toward a degree in computer science. I have no prior experience but I hope this class will give me a solid foundation to build off of. I have decided to use Python as my programming language since that is the language the examples will be given in. This seems like the least confusing way to get started. I hope learning this language will help me learn other languages with ease. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment I learned that there are many different ways to change source code. Commiting a change will erase the old version but cloning the original repository or branching off of it will keep the original repositoy unchanged. These different types of changes all play a role in version control. I also learned that there are many different IDE's available. Since I am using Python as my coding language I have chosen to use Thonny as my IDE. I'm finding it very easy to use and there are many online tutorials that are meant to help first time programmers like myself.
