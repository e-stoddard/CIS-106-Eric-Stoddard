## Assignment 1 

I am taking CIS 106 as a first step toward a degree in computer science. I have no prior experience but I hope this class will give me a solid foundation to build off of. I have decided to use Python as my programming language since that is the language the examples will be given in. This seems like the least confusing way to get started. I hope learning this language will help me learn other languages with ease.
