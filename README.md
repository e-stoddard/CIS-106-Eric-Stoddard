## Assignment 1 

I am taking CIS 106 as a first step toward a degree in computer science. I have no prior experience but I hope this class will give me a solid foundation to build off of. I have decided to use Python as my programming language since that is the language the examples will be given in. This seems like the least confusing way to get started. I hope learning this language will help me learn other languages with ease. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment I learned that there are many different ways to change source code. Commiting a change will erase the old version but cloning the original repository or branching off of it will keep the original repositoy unchanged. These different types of changes all play a role in version control. I also learned that there are many different IDE's available. Since I am using Python as my coding language I have chosen to use Thonny as my IDE. I'm finding it very easy to use and there are many online tutorials that are meant to help first time programmers like myself. 

## Assignment 3

In this assignment I learned a lot about variables and data types. For variables I learned that it is necessary to define what type of data that variable will represent (integer, real, string, boolian, etc.) before giving that variable a specific definition. I also learned about arithmetic operators and how to order it to insure the arithmetic in my program is done the way I intend. This will be useful in my future because arithmetic operators will be needed in many types of programs. 

## Assignment 4

In this assignment I was able to code my first program without the help of Flowgorithm. Using only the textbook as reference I was able to write a program that converts miles into yards, feet and inches. I was also able to successfully debug my program using Thonny's built in debugger. This is a good first step for me and gives me confidence to start confidence to start coding more difficult programs. 

## Assignment 5

In this assignment I learned how to use functions within a program. For activity 1 I used Flowgorithm to create the program and generate the corresponding pseudocode and Python code. This was helpful for me to see how each fucntion should be placed within the program. I chose to do an activity I have done before without the use of functions to see the difference they would make.

## Assignment 6

In this assignment I became much more comfortable using functions within my programs. I was able to code two programs in Python using functions without the help of Flowgorithm or any other resources. It also took me much less time than the programs I created in the previous assignment. Being comfortable using functions will definitly help me moving forward as I intend to use functions in every program I create moving forward. 

## Assignment 7

In this assignment I learned how to use conditional logic in a program. Using flowgorithm, I was able to complete activity 2 in a if then else structure. Conditional logic seems very useful in programming and I am sure I will use it a lot in the future. I was able to complete activity 3 in Python using Thonny as an IDE. 

## Assignment 8

In this assignment I learned how to use loops in a program. Using Flowgorithm I was able to complete activity 1 using a while loop. Loops seem very useful in programming and I am sure I will use them a lot in the future. I decided to use Flowgorithm for the second activity as well because I wanted a little more practice with structuring my program correctly. I will complete another activity in my own time in Python to get extra practice.   

## Assignment 9

In this assignment I learned how to use do loops to make a previous program more robust. First, I added a do loop to rerun the program as many times as the user wants before exiting the program. This will be useful in many programs moving forward to prevent the user from having to restart the program every time they want to use it. Second, I added input validation loops to insure the data the user enters makes sense. 

## Assignment 10

In this assignment I learned how to use a for loop in programming. For loops seem to be very useful when the number of iterations is known. I also learned how to create a nested loop. I'm sure I will use nested loops a lot in the future because they can process a lot of computations with only a few lines of code. 

## Assignment 11

In this assignment I learned how to use fixed arrays (lists) in Python. Specifically, I learned how to put a series of inputs into a fixed array and how to call individual members of the array. I also learned how to sort arrays based on value size and how to find the total sum of an array of numbers. 

## Assignment 12

In this assignment I learned how to use dynamic arrays (lists) in Python. I completed the same activities as last week except I replaced the fixed arrays with dynamic arrays. A dynamic array seems to work better for this activity since it does not require the user to count how many total entries they want to make before entering them. 

## Assignment 13

In this assignment I learned how to handle strings in Python. I was able to split a string into a list by a specified seperator then print each member of the list in the format required by the activity. This seems like a good way to handle date inputed by the user because it allows the user to enter everything at once instead of entering each value individually.
